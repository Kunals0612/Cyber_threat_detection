# Predicting and Forecasting Cyber Threats 🛡️🔍

# Overview 

In an increasingly digital world, the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated. This project focuses on predicting and forecasting cyber threats and their potential impacts on businesses using publicly available data. By leveraging historical data, the project aims to identify patterns and predict future cyber attacks, particularly during sensitive periods such as Black Friday or in scenarios involving significant data leakage or location-based threats.

# Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze current and historical data on cyber threats to predict future attacks and assess potential impacts on firms. Utilizing web scraping and other data collection methods, the project will focus on vulnerabilities such as system outages during high-traffic periods, data breaches, and location-specific threats exacerbated by public events or social unrest.

# Technology Stack
